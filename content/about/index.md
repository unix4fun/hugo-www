# what?!

we're just a bunch of nameless individuals/friends.

we're just having some fun with "stuff" (sound, computers, etc..)

we're trying to keep ego out of the equation.

we're trying to remains open to all sorts of technology/hacks.

we've been raised under the UNIX propaganda as it is where we've learned everything we know.

that's about it...
