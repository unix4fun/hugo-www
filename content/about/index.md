# what?!

We're just a bunch of nameless individuals/friends.

We're just having some fun with "stuff" (sound, computers, etc..)

We're trying to keep ego out of the equation.

We're trying to remains open to all sorts of technology/hacks.

We've been raised under the UNIX propaganda as it is where we've learned everything we know.

That's about it...
